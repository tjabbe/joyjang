Different from other DJ sets, there is a sense of intimacy as the attendees are positioned behind the decks in a bedroom DJ style set-up and the camera is centered on the DJ. The DJ is in control of setting the mood and tone of the party.",

Set in Berlin for the year 2033, we were to conceptualize products or services that were based on our research. Thus, ADAM was created through our team, Robotics.",

As Tom puts in the earphones on the figure, we are taken back to the time when Tom last shared music with Lois at the hospital bed– as they used to enjoy listening to music together through shared earphones.",

Noah wanted to create an alternative space that promoted cutting-edge work in a location that didn’t have cultural outlets within walking distance. We wanted to show the collection of ideas that the museum is based on. The ideas are history, culture, art and sanctuary.",
