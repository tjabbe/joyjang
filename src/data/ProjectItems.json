    "description": "This is a hypothetical logo reveal for Boiler Room. Boiler Room is a global online music broadcasting platform commissioning and streaming live music sessions around the world. Different from other DJ sets, there is a sense of intimacy as the attendees are positioned behind the decks in a bedroom DJ style set-up and the camera is centered on the DJ. The DJ is in control of setting the mood and tone of the party.",
